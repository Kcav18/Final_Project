*Location of data (link to google drive)


[CMPD Data Portal](https://data.charlottenc.gov/search?collection=Dataset)

This portal has a dataset called "CMPD Violent Crime."
- It contains the year and type of crime committed. It does not specifically list the location but does provide an "NPA" code per crime. That stands for "neighborhood profile area." 
- The NPA code can be linked with other datasets and shapefiles to get locations across the CMPD area. (Trying to find how to link them).
- There are other crime datasets available (such as crimes that are ***not*** considered "violent")

Ideas:

- Machine Learning: Probability of a violent crime occuring in a specific zipcode/neighborhood area.
- Machine Learning: Predicting which month has the highest liklihood of violent crime.
- Could combine the crime that is labeled violent and the crime that is not considered violent - and then predict the 'type' of crime that could occur in a specific neighborhood

Just my thoughts - thought I would go ahead and jot them here.
